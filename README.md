# Python for Data Analysis
This repository is inspired by the book "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney (second edition). The main idea behind this repository is to provide a practical and hands-on approach to learning data analysis using Python.

## About the Repository
This repository contains custom tasks, exercises, and examples inspired by the concepts covered in the book. While the core concepts and datasets are from the book, the examples and tasks have been customized using Python scripts to provide a unique learning experience. All author rights, copyrights, and licenses as outlined in the original book are observed and respected.

## Tasks and Examples

### Baby Names in the USA (1880 - 2010)

Explore and analyze baby names in the USA from 1880 to 2010. The result is a figure with three plots:

1. Total amount of births by gender.
2. The number of most popular boys' names given per year.
3. The number of most popular girls' names given per year.

### USA.gov Data from Bitly

Analyze data from Bitly about users who make shorter links ending with .gov or .mil. The result is a figure with three plots:

1. Displaying the first ten time zones from the dataset 1.usa.gov.
2. Highlighting the first ten time zones used by Windows users and other users.
3. Showing the percentage of Windows users and other users in the first ten time zones.

### MovieLens 1M Dataset

Analyze data from the MovieLens 1M dataset, focusing on movies released between 1990 and 2000. The result is a figure with two plots:

1. Average ratings by gender.
2. Users' average age by gender.
